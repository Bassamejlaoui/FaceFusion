**Description:** This web application allows users to create images of a specified character in different poses using a consistent character workflow. It leverages the Gradio library for building the interface and handles the image generation process via HTTP requests to a backend server.

**Key Features:**
- **Prompt Input:** Users can describe the subject, including details like clothes and hairstyle for better consistency.
- **Negative Prompt:** Allows specifying elements that should not appear in the generated images, ensuring higher quality and relevance.
- **Image Settings:**
  - Number of Outputs: Number of different images to generate.
  - Number of Images Per Pose: Number of images to generate for each specified pose.
  - Randomize Poses: Option to randomize poses for variety.
  - Output Format: Choice between webp, jpg, and png formats.
  - Output Quality: Adjustable quality of the output images.
  - Seed: Set a seed for reproducibility of results.

**Safety Check:** The safety check function uses an external API to verify the appropriateness of the user's prompt. If the prompt is deemed unsafe, the image generation process is halted.

**Backend Integration:** The application sends a POST request with user inputs to a backend server for processing. It polls the server until the image generation is complete and retrieves the results for display.

**Interface:** The interface is structured using Gradio's Blocks and Columns, providing a user-friendly layout with advanced settings accessible via an accordion component. The final generated images are displayed in a gallery.

**Example Usage:** 
1. Enter a prompt describing the character (e.g., "a person, dark blue suit, black tie, white pocket").
2. Optionally, upload an image of the subject for more personalized results.
3. Adjust advanced settings such as negative prompt, number of outputs, output format, etc.
4. Click "Submit" to generate the images.

**Technical Details:**
- **Libraries Used:** Gradio, Requests, Time, OS, Re
- **API Integration:** Uses an external safety checker API and a local backend for image generation.
- **Error Handling:** Captures and displays errors to the user if the image generation fails or if the prompt is unsafe.

### Code Breakdown

- **Imports and Initialization:** Imports necessary libraries and initializes the Gradio client with a Hugging Face token.
- **Safety Check Function:** Verifies the prompt using the safety checker API.
- **Predict Function:** Processes user inputs, sends a request to the backend server, and handles the response.
- **Gradio Interface:** Defines the layout and components of the web application, including text boxes, sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, and a gallery for displaying results.
- **App Launch:** Configures and launches the Gradio app with specified settings.

This project exemplifies the use of Gradio for building interactive web applications with robust backend integration and a focus on user experience.
